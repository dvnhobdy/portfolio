                <h2>The Company</h2>
                <p>SoundCloud is the home of music‚Äôs deepest cuts, and culture‚Äôs most exciting scenes. As a streaming platform with a focus on user-generated content, our most dedicated users are young curators looking to stay updated on everything new in music, + young musicians looking for career/industry advice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>I believed that our blog could potentially be an educational resource for both of those users, but at the time it was all but abandoned. Content wasn‚Äôt categorized, tagging served no purpose, and the blog posts themselves were years old.</p>
                
                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/old%20soundcloud.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">SC blog circa 2018</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Stakeholders were ready to get rid of it completely, and I honestly couldn‚Äôt blame them. But growing up in the music blog era, I knew that there was a power in this experience - it just needed a focused face lift, and a different content strategy. So I convinced my team to let me take a shot at a refresh. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Focus</h2>
                <p>I pinpointed two potential problem areas that would drive the redesign:</p>
                <p>The first problem area was the navigational experience. At the time, users landed in the middle of a post, and scrolled through a sea of content in the hopes of finding something interesting. How could I make this experience less tedious/feel more tailored to discerning readers? </p>
                
                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/feed.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">the ENTIRE experience</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>The second area was content organization. At the time, content wasn't grouped, making it a chore to read related posts unless they were posted in succession. What would the most effective ways of categorizing + surfacing related content look like?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Discovery Process</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt make a business case for using more robust tools for user discovery. Determined,  I conducted user interviews using all the co-workers and music-loving friends I had at my disposal. I learned that people really enjoyed the easily navigate-able experiences of online publications like complex + wonderland.</p>
                <p>I dug into these types of editorial experiences, and realized that they began with a content hub populated with various kinds of primer ‚Äúarticle cards‚Äù. Organization of these cards varied - some sites bucketed content by type, while others were organized by recency. These cards linked out to full length articles with clickable tags, allowing users to quickly navigate to similar content + serving as a means by which the site could suggest similar content at the end of the article. </p>
                <p>I worked with our head copywriter, Anna Svoboda, and we determined that organizing content by type was important for the redesign. We audited the old blog to understand what our most important categories were, and settled on ‚ÄúNews‚Äù, ‚ÄúResources‚Äù, + ‚ÄúContests‚Äù.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Design Process</h2>
                <p>I began sketching out different user flows. The most obvious experience begins at the content hub + guides users through their catgeory of choice, to the most relevant (set of) articles. </p>

                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/flow%201.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>But after consulting our social media team, I realized that people most often navigate straight to an article from a twitter or instagram link, so it was important to make sure that these kinds of users could easily click through relevant content without having to return to the main page. </p>

                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/flow%202.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>The extremely talented engineer I was working on this project with - Mart√≠n Salmovary, directed my attention to an important consideration. While we intended to archive the old version of the blog + all of its articles, we also had to consider a niche, but important user group - people who often revisited these archived articles. We had to design a flow that preserved the articles they loved, and directed them to newer related content. </p>
                
                 <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/flow%203.png" alt="">
                </div>


            <div class="row">
                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>With these flows mapped out I got to work on the specifics of content categorization. I opted for a tabbed solution on the homepage that encouraged users to narrow their reading experience. They would see relevant featured articles, followed by other articles of their chosen type.</p>

                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/homepage.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">categorized homepage - desktop</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/homepage%20mobile.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">categorized homepage - mobile</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Then I adopted a tagging solution in articles, that directed users to a page of similarly tagged articles. I also added a similar post link at the bottom of the page that would use tags to surface related articles.</p>
                
                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/article.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">Article page - Desktop</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="/images/article%20mobile.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">article page - mobile</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>We moved forward with archiving older articles. Because of the existing Wordpress framework, my engineering partner was able to roll older posts into the newer design. He scraped those posts for relevant keywords, and was able to retroactively assign tags to these pages, making them more searchable for newer readers, and connecting them to newer articles for older ones. </p>
                <p>The UI was driven by the existing design language of soundcloud.com, combining the readability of interstate with the high contrast orange, dark grey, + white palette SoundCloud is known for.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>My Takeways</h2>
                <p>This was the first design project I led from start to finish, but I learned a ton about cross functional collaboration in the process. Specifically, I learned the value of bringing engineers into the conception phase. Mart√≠n‚Äôs understanding of the old blog‚Äôs backend gave him valuable insights that heavily informed the design process. </p>
                <p>Because of his input, and that of other teams in the org, we were able to create a new experience that has since become the central location for all of SoundCloud‚Äôs long form content + external communication. The new blog boasts around 600k unique monthly views (1M in April 2020), far outpacing the older variant.</p>
                <p>SoundCloud‚Äôs design guidelines + desktop language are currently moving in a direction that I am very excited for, and looking back at the blog, there are so many UI decisions that I‚Äôd love to reconsider. I‚Äôm looking forward to the gradual evolution of this experience, and proud of my work in establishing it.</p>
