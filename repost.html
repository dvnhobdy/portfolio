                <h2>The Company</h2>
                <p>Repost is a distribution and artist services company that was recently acquired by SoundCloud. With competitive pricing, impressive performance dashboards, and a diligent artist relations team, theyâ€™re a powerful player in the artists services space.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Welcoming Repost into the SoundCloud family required an overhaul of their landing experience, not only to unite our brands, but to account for their new role in SoundCloudâ€™s pricing structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Focus</h2>
                <p>The Repost landing page was fine structurally, but I was tasked with using SoundCloudâ€™s developing design language to make it feel like a part of our experience. The team wanted this redesign to reflect the exciting nature of the Repost productâ€™s inclusion in the SoundCloud ecosystem, while showcasing Repostâ€™s roots.</p>
                
                <div class="gallery-lg support-image">
                    <img class="gallery_image" src="images/repost%20ancient.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">old landing page</div>
                </div>
                
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Design Process</h2>
                <p>After I redesigned Repostâ€™s logo, I began migrating their homepage content into the patterns I built for SoundCloudâ€™s <a href="https://creators.soundcloud.com/">creator microsite</a>. While this pushed us closer to brand cohesion, it was lacking in overall impact. Repost is all about career momentum, and pushing artists to the next level of professional development, and their landing experience needed to communicate those qualities of movement + progress.</p>

                    <img class="gallery_image" src="images/repost%20old.png" alt="">
                    <div class="label right">intermediate landing page</div>
                </div>

                <p>I decided to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, using bold animated typography, textural video backgrounds, and an interactive infographic giving a top level explanation of Repostâ€™s plans. </p>

                    <div class="label right">landing page header</div>
                </div>

                <p>I also coupled user testimonials with plan value propositions, to bring value + social proof closer together.</p>
