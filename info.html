                <h2>Hi I'm Dev</h2>
                <p>I‚Äôm a multidisciplinary designer with ui/ux, brand, motion design, and front-end experience (I built this site from scratch!). I‚Äôm passionate about ethical, user-centered design, digital activism, and the intersection of tech and music.</p>

                <p>I currently work as a brand designer at SoundCloud, and make music with my best friend Corey, for a project called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3BBN1P1JNw0sSdYEdBkOZK?si=EwwA4Cp1RDqmT1mBIGXcKg">Bathe</a>.</p>
                
                <p>I also have two younger sisters, Amaya and Simone, and they are the most important people in my world. Almost everything that I (want to) create is purposed with making the world an easier place for them to navigate as <a href="https://dvnhobdy.github.io/protestpack/">women of color</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Anyway, I‚Äôm currently looking to work as a product designer on a team full of folks who believe in the democratizing power of technology (and who can link me to dope playlists). Also hit me up for freelance work! Okay, bye.</p>
